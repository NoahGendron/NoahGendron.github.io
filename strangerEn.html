              <h1 class="project-details__sub">Gamemodes</h1>

              <h2>Campaign</h2>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The campaign mode is focused on PvE through a diverse variety of objectives that the player can complete during missions, 
                alone or with up to three player teammates. 
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                This mode seems, on the surface, very simple, but it is by far the most complex one to develop, since it demands handcrafted, refined levels made specifically for players to 
                accomplish certain objectives with certain scenarios in mind, while still being able to explore. Every single mission objective has to be programmed and personalized specifically for it, in order for 
                each mission to stand out. The player can explore the levels in order to receive rewards, they can avoid certain optional side objectives to be quicker and they can sometimes
                 accomplish specific objectives in different ways. 
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The reward obtained by the player at the end of a level is completely determined by the score they obtain. Their score is determined by the amount of enemies they killed, the time they took to beat the mission,
                 as well as the amounts of times they died. These factors determine the score, which will dictate the <strong>percentage</strong> of a total of of experience points and gold.
                 In general, if the percentage of the rewards is above 50%, it guarantees the player at the very least one item reward
                 , even if the mission failed. This system applies to the all the gamemodes. 
              </p>

              <h2>Survival</h2>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                In the survival mode, up to 10 players must protect their base from waves of diverse enemies while also managing their funds in 
                order to augment their own stats as the gmae goes on. This mode is the most simple and direct in Age of Conquest, but it still has its own unique mecanics which make it stand out.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The heart of this mode is determined by the enemy spawning system. Before each start of a new wave, the game determines the type of difficulty that fits the wave,
                 and, among the already-crafted waves of each type, it selects one randomly, then it spawns enemies in the map. However, this is not automatic. The system determines first if there 
                 are enoiugh players in the server to spawn every single enemy in the wave. Then, it starts a countdown for the enemies that don't spawn immediately at the start of the wave, since it wouldn't feel natural if all the enemies appeared at the same time. 
                  If the enemies that appear at the start are eleminated before the other enemies' countdowns end, the enemies with the smallest countdowns will all spawn at the same time, and reduce the other enemies' countdowns. 
                  This way, players don't have to wait for more to spawn. This system also, partly, applies to the campaign.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                As well as the difficulty multiplier added at the end of each wave, the system also gives out an amount of funds to the players. This amount is determined by the difficulty of the wave and the time it took 
                for players to defeat it. The wave funds are also reduced each time a player dies in an active wave. They are then distributed to the players, and they can then be used in a survival mode exclusive menu 
                that gives the ability to spend funds to augment stats, like damage multipliers, speed, attack speed, health, defense, etc. Each stat costs a certain amount to augment. Funds can also be utilized to level up your base's 
                defenses, like the walls that defend your General. However, enemies can still easily break those walls if players aren't there to defend them. 
              </p>

              <h2>Team Battle</h2>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Finally the team battle mode is the mode that allows players to both battle enemies and other players. It is, by far, the most complex gamemode in Age of Conquest. 
                As well as the PvP aspect, players have to defend their General (boss enemy/ally) or defeat the enemy team's General. 
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                At the start of a match, the players must vote for a team leader, which will then be capable of hiring workers (type of AI), who will boost the team's funds, 
                and those funds will be used to summon reinforcements, or an ally boss. Players who are not team leader still have access to the funds system, with those funds, they can repair and upgrade structures, 
                certain structures help defend your base or give bonuses to your team, others can host archers that fend off enemies, and the most important structures, the barracks, each spawn a wave of enemies periodically, which can be 
                augmented by upgrading it. Players can also use their own funds to purchase outpost, which can also spawn extra allies. 
              </p>
              
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Players accumulate funds by eliminating enemy AIs or enemy players, but they can't be too rash, because they lose most of their funds upon death. Rushing all alone towards the enemy base 
                is heavily discouraged because of this, especially at the start of a match, where enemy defenses are at their strongest.
                 To balance fights between players, the player's gear level is adjusted according to their adversary. In this way, low level players always stand a chance, even when facing more experienced players. 
              </p>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The maps of this mode and balanced around a minimum level of entry, as well as a "maximum" level (a player's stats are capped at the maximum if they exceed it).
                Certain aspects of the game and its enemy types are only accessible in the game's high level maps, so that players are not too overwhelemed at the start of the game. 
              </p>

              <h1 class="project-details__sub">Combat and Gameplay</h1>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                In terms of combat against enemies, the player can have up to five weapons equipped at all times. most weapons are unique, 
                and they correspond to one of the three main classes that determine the player's style of play. The melee class wields close range weapons, utilizing <i>hitboxes</i>, made using <i>raycasts</i>.
                This system also applies to melee enemies. Each weapon category has its own attacks and animations, as well as attacking at different speeds. Each weapon has a normal attack and a special attack, which 
                consumes stamina. 
                <br><br>
                To encourage an aggressive combat style, but punishing recklessness, players become vulnerable when they begin an attack, since they cannot perform most other actions, 
                their stat changes (like a State-Machine). However, the time to recover once the attack is finished is very short, often leaving players time to dodge or parry incoming attacks if they are well-timed.
                <br><br>
                To invalidate enemy attacks, the player has three main options: dodge (roll), parry, or block. The roll gives the player invincibility frames and allows repositioning,
                This is particularly effective when fighting large numbers of enemies. However, rolling costs a lot of stamina and timing your dodge can be tricky. To prevent players from
                 spamming dodges, the stamina consumed by rolls increases with each successive dodge. 
                 
                 Players also have the option to block or parry using the same button/key. If the timing of the parry is right, the player can nullify all enemy damage and inflict posture damage, with very few drawbacks.
                 disadvantages. If the player's timing is poor, however, the parry becomes a block, which is far less effective. Blocking causes the player to lose energy, as well as raising his or her own 
                 posture bar. What's more, some attacks cannot be blocked; these are indicated by red markers. To prevent the player from overusing parries, the time given to the player to correctly 
                 time the parry becomes smaller with each successive parry.
                  <br><br>
                  What is player/enemy posture? It's the invisible bar that determines when a character becomes vulnerable, taking several times more damage. 
                  To break an enemy's posture, you need to parry and/or attack them while they're blocking. This system is very similar to the one found <i>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</i>.                  
              </p>

              <h1 class="project-details__sub">Artifical Intelligence</h1>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Age of Conquest's Artificial Intelligence is as complex as it is modular. To ensure that enemies can be used in all three distinct game modes, the AI relies 
                on three types of movement: defensive, offensive and wandering. 
                <ul>
                  <li class="project-details__desc-li">
                    Defensive AIs remain stationary until a target enters their attack range; if an enemy target lures them too far out of their range, they will attempt to return to their initial defensive position.                  
                  </li>
                  <li class="project-details__desc-li">
                      Offensive AIs have a given approximate path that directs them towards a specific goal, using "Pathfinding".

                  <li class="project-details__desc-li">
                    Wandering AIs are like defensive AIs, except that they wander a certain distance from their starting point.                  </li>

                  To keep battles fair, players can normally not be attacked by more than one AI at the same time. In general, the player can only be attacked by one melee enemy, and one ranged enemy.
                  However, this constraint can be bypassed, if an AI is granted the right to do so, given that the player is close enough. It can also be bypassed if the player is in the enemy base, 
                  or he may be targeted by a large number of AIs. Fortunately, it's much harder for AIs to chase players when they're already being attacked by other AIs, so they lose 
                  much of their rotational tracking strength and velocity, making dodging/rolling ideal for crowd combat.

                  Finally, in terms of combat itself, each type of enemy has its own animations and attacks, with their own attack and recovery times. Age of Conquest's AIs are "state-machines", so they react to an enemy's  state changes by changing their own state, depending on what they're up against. 
                  Each time a player fights an AI, the AI will develop a strategy, depending on the player's state and distance. 
                  This strategy affects where the AI will position itself and what attack it will decide to use. It can retreat if the player attacks it, try to circle around the player if he's already being attacked by other enemies, or rush in if the player is too far away or escaping. 
                  Then, she can decide which of her attacks she should use, if her opponent is at the right distance. 
                  Enemies who use melee combat can generally block their opponents' blows, at the risk of becoming vulnerable if their posture breaks. Others can dodge attacks, but receive no invincibility franes to avoid frustrating players. 
                  All this is determined by a handful of functions in a single script, when provided with the parameters of an AI in combat. The system reuses as little code as possible.
